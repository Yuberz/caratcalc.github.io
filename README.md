# CaratCalc
A Umamusume: Pretty Derby income calculator. Access the website [here.](https://yuberz.github.io/caratcalc.github.io/)

## Features
- Calculates guaranteed income between banners.
- Features banners up to Mejiro Dober.
- Allows customization for income (Team trials rating and monthly pass ownership)

## Caveats
- Does not currently have all banners listed.
- Does not currently account for future event income very accurately. (Has to be entered manually, and cygames could change carats earned).
- Janky site behavior in general. Lots is subject to change.

## TODO
- Add all of the upcoming banners up to JP.
- Continue to update images to English as they become available.
- Restyle the site to look better/more umamusume-like?
- Add HELP button to explain how to use the calculator and some of its eccentricities.
- Add a credit at the bottom that links to this repository.
- Add basic Champions Meeting support.

## FAQ
### What are some of the calculator's "eccentricities"?
- The calculator uses the END date of the banner to calculate income, giving the user the best odds possible to obtain the most amount of carats from dailies and stuff before the banner ends which is realistic if you're running on a budget.
- The calculator also cannot account for randomness or "bouncing" between team trial ranks / club ranks, so the recommended thing to do in that situation is use the lower rank in order to show the "worst case scenario".

## Credits
- All images are pulled from [Gametora](https://gametora.com/umamusume/gacha) in order to have a consistent appearance.
- Date predictions for future banners are taken from [uma.moe](https://uma.moe).

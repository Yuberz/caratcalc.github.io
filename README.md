# CaratCalc
A Umamusume: Pretty Derby income calculator. Access the website [here.](https://yuberz.github.io/caratcalc.github.io/)

## Features
- Calculates guaranteed income between banners.
- Features banners up to Mejiro Dober.
- Allows customization for income (Team trials rating and monthly pass ownership)

## Caveats
- Does not currently have all banners listed.
- Does not currently account for future event income very accurately. (Has to be entered manually, and cygames could change carats earned).
- Janky site behavior in general. Lots is subject to change.

## TODO
- Add all of the upcoming banners up to JP.
- Continue to update images to English as they become available.
- Restyle the site to look better/more umamusume-like?
- Add HELP button to explain how to use the calculator.
- Add a credit at the bottom that links to this repository.

## Credits
- All images are pulled from [Gametora](https://gametora.com/umamusume/gacha) in order to have a consistent appearance.
